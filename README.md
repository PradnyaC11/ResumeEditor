# ResumeEditor

This repository contains a Python script for updating a resume in small ways, like changing specific words/short phrases. The input is the template file, like one given 'Resume_Template_8_Java_Angular.docx'. And the output will be an updated docx/latex file and a PDF of the same. 

editor.py - script for editing Word docx
latexEditor.py - script for editing latex file

Please make changes to the script wherever you see file paths. Also, in the LaTeX editor, I have multiple resume templates from which I was selecting, as per the job description. 

The commands to run the script are as follows - 

For Word - 
python editor.py

For LaTeX - 
python latexEditor.py 1
1 here represents to index of the resume that I want to edit.
